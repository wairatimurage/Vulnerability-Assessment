# Vulnerability Assessment Tool

## Overview
The Vulnerability Assessment Tool is a Python script designed to analyze code for potential security vulnerabilities. It leverages Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module to parse code and identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.

## Features
- Supports analysis of Python code.
- Detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Provides detailed information about detected vulnerabilities, including their type and location in the code.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply clone the repository or download the Python script and run it using a Python interpreter.

## Usage
1. Open the Python script (`vulnerability_assessment.py`) in a text editor.
2. Replace the sample Python code in the `main()` function with the code you want to analyze.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. View the output to see if any potential vulnerabilities were detected.
